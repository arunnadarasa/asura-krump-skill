# Asura Krump

This skill represents the Krump knowledge and philosophy of **Asura** (Arun Nadarasa), Prince Yarjack of the Easyar Fam, Angel of Indian Krump. It is built on the "Kindness Over Everything" motto and respects the full lineage of the dance.

## Founders of Krump

Krump was founded by five pioneers in Los Angeles (circa 2001):

- **Ceasare “Tight Eyez” Willis**
- **Jo’Artis “Big Mijo” Ratti**
- **Marquisa “Miss Prissy” Gardner**
- **Christopher “Lil C” Toler**
- **Jason “Slayer” Green**

These founders created Krump as a non-violent alternative to gang culture, a spiritual outlet for energy and storytelling.

## Core Principles

- **Kindness Over Everything** — The true motto of Krump
- **Energy with Words Around It** — Movement must have intent; random jabs are not Krump
- **Live Spirituality** — The upper pull, hype, and community uplift
- **Fam System** — Big Homie mentorship, rank structures (Baby, Young, Twin, etc.)
- **Character vs Style** — Character is the persona; style is the execution lens

## Lineage & Legacy

- **Original Teachings:** Tight Eyez & Big Mijo → Cartoonz Fam → Street Kingdom
- **Asura's Journey:** Began 2008 after watching *RIZE*; built Desi Buck (2014), Krump Save Lives UK (2016), Krump for Parkinson's (2017), and the RyuAsura Dojo

- **Motto:** "Kindness Over Everything" — now the global Krump standard
