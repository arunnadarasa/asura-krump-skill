# KRUMP HISTORY AND FUNDAMENTALS

## Meaning and Origins

KRUMP stands for "Kingdom Radically Uplifted Mighty Praise"

Krump is a freestyle dance form popularized in 2001 in the streets of South Central, Los Angeles (USA), characterized by free, expressive, exaggerated, and highly energetic movement.

The youths who originated krumping, 'Tight Eyez' and 'Big Mijo', saw the dance as a way for them to escape gang life and to release anger, aggression and frustration in a positive, non-violent way. This was an opposition to street violence, which was prevalent due to violent gangster activities.

With the cinema documentary 'RIZE' (2005) by the Hollywood Director "David LaChapelle," Krump has spread all around the world.

Today, Krumping has worldwide influence in the dance culture, but Krumping still has difficulty gaining acceptance by our society as an art form. Primarily, because people do not understand this dance form and its spirit.

## Evolution of Styles

### Old Style (2001-2008)
The "Old Style" of Krump refers to the era of Krump (2001-2008) in which fast paced movements was the key factor in winning battles. It was made popular through Krump Kings and music from J-Squad.

### New Style (Post-2008)
In 2008, following the disbandment of Krump Kings, Tight Eyez went on to create "Street Kingdom" (SK) which created the era of "New Style" of Krump where intro and storyline was the key factor in winning battles. This is what made Krump a big buzz in the Hip Hop scene since it was more structured and harder to beat in an "All-styles" battle.

SK also become leader in beat making overshadowing J-Squad work which was now out-dated as the music used much more different paces than Before. By travelling around the world, Tight Eyez created different groups in different countries to represent his style of Krump:

● HSK (Holland Street Kingdom)
● SKA (Street Kingdom Australia)
● KSK (Korea Street Kingdom)
● RSK (Russia Street Kingdom)
● SKJ (Street Kingdom Japan)
● SKSA (Street Kingdom South Africa)

## Core Concepts and Techniques

Krump is like an energy with words around it which can only be expressed through your body not with your voice, your body turns into the words.

The energy which you use to say words, that's "Krump" - arms swings, jabs, arm placements, stomps, posture, chest pop, focus points, grooving, bouncing = all of these are to express the energy.

Random jabs is NOT krump, what's making you execute the moves is Krump.

Krump is in the inside making you move, there are people who understand Krump who don't dance.

## Character Development

Character is what changed Krump forever. Eyez used to wear a cap so that the opponent couldn't see his face to dominate him as he was young back then, it wasn't to look cool – he used to look down the whole time.

His spirituality enabled him to change people live just by them watching him and told about it when he was 17.

You cannot perfect the feeling of Krump but you can perfect the movements – you will be different every time you dance.
